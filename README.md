## much_jeopardy

> Five thousand random questions from the show Jeopardy

### But why?
I have a friend who's about to fly to California and (possibly) be a contestant on the best game show ever! That's why. She asked if there was any way she could turn the questions from j-archive.com in to some type of flash card-like thing she could study on her phone. And thus _much_jeopardy_ was born.

#### Mega Thanks:
This wouldn't have been done if it wasn't for [j-archive](http://j-archive.com/) cataloging all the questions. And I also want to thank [whymarrh](https://github.com/whymarrh/) for making a script to scrape the questions from j-archive. I started doing it myself when my friend sent me a link to his gihub like,
> "Pleeease tell me there's something you can do with this!"

#### Note:
At the moment there's 5000 questions up and data isn't cheap. Please use the 'Random' button to load a new question rather than refreshing the whole page. It really uses up a lot of bandwidth loading the darn thing so much. Thanks.
