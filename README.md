## much jeopardy

_Five thousand random questions from the hit show Jeopardy_

### But why?
Got a friend who's about to fly to California to be a contestant on the best game show ever! That's why! She asked if there was any way she could turn the questions from j-archive.com in to some type of flash card-like thing she could study on her phone. And BAM! _much jeopardy_.

#### Mega Thanks:
To [j-archive](http://j-archive.com/) for cataloging all these damn questions. And to [whymarrh](https://github.com/whymarrh/) for writing the script I used to scrape everything. I started writing one myself when my friend sent me a link to his github being like,
> "Pleeease tell me there's something you can do with this!"

Also gotta thank [lupas](https://github.com/lupas) for nuxt-fire. Made it super easy to drop the questions from Firebase in to nuxt.

Anyway, GOOD LUCK PEGGAH!

#### Note:
At the moment there's 5000 questions up and data isn't cheap. Please use the 'Random' button to load a new question rather than refreshing the whole page. It really uses up a lot of bandwidth loading the darn thing so much. Thanks.
